## Introduction

This site is to help visualize different sorting algorithms. 

## Wireframes

## User Stories
- User should be able to select the algorithm from which he/she can sort the array
- User can specify the size of the array
- User can instruct when to start the sorting. 
- User can specify the speed of sorting
- User can change the speed while sorting is in progress

## Site Owner Goals
- Easy to use
- Easy to understand
